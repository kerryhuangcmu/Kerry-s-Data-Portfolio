Romance Scams: Understanding potential risks in Dating Apps
In this digital age, dating apps have revolutionized how people meet and form relationships. While dating apps offer a convenient way to meet new people and can foster genuine relationships, they can also become a gray area sometimes because users can’t verify who is talking to them and trust is based on digital interactions. This can give some people the chance to exploit: an unjust intention of romance scams: Utilizing people’s trust and emotions to commit fraud. 
My goal is to inform the audience about potential risks of dating apps without demonizing them.  I’m interested in showing data to cautious people against certain aspects of dating apps. It’s not to say dating apps are bad, but emotional investment online can sometimes lead to unwanted outcomes. It is important to identify the hazards of such so that in future people can be more protected from being scammed, both mentally and financially. 
I would also like to elaborate on the effects being scammed has on people’s emotional status. I want to build this into my topic of dating apps scam because I think they are interconnected. It is easy to internalize the faults of being scammed and blame oneself. This is also an important topic to pay attention to. 
In general, I hope to use clear and engaging visual representations of existing data to bring people’s attention to this issue. My goal is not to demonize dating apps but simply to raise awareness and provide people with this knowledge in order to protect themselves. 

Here is my story structure:
Setup: Romance scams are real!
Conflict: Can harm people both mentally and financially.
Resolution: Using data to become more informed about this situation and be aware of any monetary transactions that is asked of you

Breaking down the structure: 
Introduction: 
Overview on the numbers of users of the major dating apps
Conflict:
Inferences of the ratio of fake identities on dating apps and a user’s chance of encountering one 
Data on percentage of people and monetary losses to romance scams in the past few years
Data on the most prominent methods of romance scams that draw people in emotionally and financially
Resolution:
Advices and how users can use the knowledge to be more cautious


## Initial sketches
I plan to use pie charts and histograms for data visualization.

I plan to use a lot of grey in my graphs of pie charts to make the most important data stand out. This is used to compare the ratio of those that are victims and those that are not. 
I plan to use more color when ranking the methods of romance scams. I plan to also use line graphs or area charts when tracking the monetary values of romance scams over the past few years.

# The data
I will primarily be recreating data based on various sources. My data sources come from governmental platforms such as the Federal Trade Commission, data platforms such as Statista, and credible news platforms.
My sources of information tackle these aspects: The most common types of scams and phrases/topics that scammers use to swindle people on dating apps; data of how much money has be frauded, what ratios of people are being scammed in each dating apps, and more. 
I plan to also collect data regarding the download rates of prominent dating apps, for example, Tinder and Hinge, and to make reasonable correlations between users of dating apps and victims of scams. For example, “X percentage in the overall user population” or “X in X people”.

This is data on scams in general and how it influences victims of scams. I will build this source into my topic.
