# Wireframes / storyboards
I build a rough draft on Shorthand first, then after my first round of interview (see first half of User research section), I developed the following outline of the story. Below is an abbrevicate version that outline the key points of my story. I used this outline as a storyboard for my second round of interviews.

# User research 

## Target audience

Dating app is a very ordinary tool in the current years. There isn’t an age limit on using dating apps, and it can be a way to encounter new relationships. Yet there are grey areas with meeting people online, especially when there is no requirement to meet in person. People can have intentions other than what’s supposed to be when using dating apps. 

Representative individuals I identify are people who have experiences of at least 1 year using dating apps and have experiences talking to people on those platforms. They are the age group of 20ish, which is the group that grows up with the digital technologies. 

The story is primary for those who are talking to and on the path of forming relationships online. Although most of my data come from the United States, I beleive they can be applied to other scenarios, because I believe romance scams is more of a universal issue. I hope to reach current and potential users of dating apps with this story so they can be more cautious as they make decisions about the interactions on dating apps. 


## Interview script
My **first round of interviews** are conducted after I have a rough draft of my story on Shorthand. I briefly introduced my story and showed the interviewees my draft, and asked them some general questions about the draft.
