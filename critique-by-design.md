# Critique and Redesign: Improve Data Visualization and Analysis on Universities' Student Loans in the United States

## Step one: the visualization

In my Telling Stories with Data course with Professor Goranson, we worked on redesigning a data visualization from either a professional organization or government agency. Here is the example I picked:
MakeoverMonday: 12/06/2021, What Schools Create the Most Student Loans in the U.S.?

Student loans/debt is a pressing issue, because although receiving education seems to be a right, in some particular places, the cost of tuition can be a significant financial burden for people. This graph illustrates the universities that rank highest in student loans in each state, highlighting how this issue is represented throughout the country. 

I selected this particular data visualization because while it has the potential to tell a compelling story and raise awareness on an important problem, the execution of the graph is unsuccessful in doing so. Rather, the graph presents too much information without clear organization, making it difficult for the viewers to gain meaningful insights clearly, quickly, and effectively. When I first clicked on the link, I was overwhelmed by the colors and the massive amount of information crammed all into the map. Although contextual explanations in the article helped me understand what the visualization is about, it contained too much information and took a while to process. There was a need to redesign it. The graph is trying to talk about too many things, making it lose focus. My goal is to redesign this visualization using some parts of the data that I found the most important in telling a clearer, stronger story about student loans in the United States. 

## Step two: the critique

Overall, although the data visualization contains a lot of useful information, it is not very effective. The idea of map is good, but having it static crams all information and makes it crowded. It is better to make it interactive, but to make the visualization straight to the point, it will be better to reduce the amount of information. 

Using Stephen Few’s Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile (https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf ) I critiqued the data visualization based on Few’s 7 criterias and assigned a score from 1-10 for each criteria, with 1 being the least ideal : 

Usefulness - 7
- Articulates a topic that matters. Information is overall useful (ex. name of schools, type of schools, and loan amounts) but is trying to discuss too much in a single graph, which makes it ineffective.  

Completeness - 6
- The graph includes more information than necessary, making it harder to digest. A more focused approach would improve clarity.
  - For example, in “Total Loans Originated”, there are 12 variables matching type of school (public, private, and proprietary) with 4 categories (Less than $100M, $100M-$299M, $300M-$499M, and $500M and More) and 9 colors.

Perceptibility - 5
- Hard to perceive with minimal effort. Requires actually observing the graph for a while. The graph is not effective in the way it presents its information.

Truthfulness - 10
- Accurate and valid data, tackles a real issue, represents what it claims.

Intuitiveness - 5
- Similarly to perceptibility, the graph is not intuitive to be easily understood. 
- The graph forces viewers to make multiple connections. Colors represent both the type of school and the loan amounts, making the interpretation less immediate. 

Aesthetics - 5
- Too many colors that are highly saturated, not pleasing to the eye.
- School logos are different sizes and some are unclearly displaced, they also add excessive graphic elements that clutters the map design.
- A lot of protruding lines and logos on the right side of the graph makes it look busy, and the visual weight of the graph is not evenly distributed. 

Engagement - 8
- The topic itself is an engaging topic, but the visualization can be distracting. It really depends on how much patience one has reading this graph. 

How to implement the redesign:

I will use a bar chart instead of a map, as geographic representation can sometimes be more difficult to locate states quickly. Maps have spatial limitations, especially for smaller states, making it harder to display information. Instead, I will list the state in parentheses next to each university’s name. Since I intend my target audience to be upcoming college students, I want to focus the attention on how high student loans can play into the judgement of selecting education. Therefore, to keep the graph focused and avoid overcrowding, I will use only the “Top 10 Universities With the Highest Loan Originations by State” rather than all 50 states’ data. I will also simplify the color scheme by using distinct colors for school types (public, private-nonprofit, proprietary). The current approach—using 12 colors to represent both school type and loan amounts—is overly complex and confusing and requires more than one graph if implemented. 

Evaluation of the critique tool:

For this data visualization redesign critique, Stephen Few’s Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile is highly effective. It provides a clear, structured framework, which allows designers to think from different angles. Another method of critique is the Good Charts Method by Scott Berinato, which contains 5 steps that are more general instructions such as making notes on observations and what one dislikes or likes. As we can compare, Few’s approach offers specific criterias that provides structured directions for the designer to execute, each with clear explanations and measurable scales, whereas the Good Charts Method relies on more subjective questions that require more interpretation and judgment from the designer. As a designer newbie, I think using Few’s method to test the functionality of a data visualization creates more precise and actionable outcomes.
One thing that Few’s method can improve on is to add a measure of “Coloring Effectiveness” to Few’s method. While color overlaps a little with the criterias of aesthetics and readability, it also plays a crucial role in conveying meaning. This category could include “consistency” (ensuring the color scheme aligns with the dataset’s message) and “attention-focusing” (assessing whether color guides or distracts viewers).

## Step four: Test the solution

This is the script I used during the critique in class. I modified the questions from a sample provided by Professor Goranson.
- What do you think this data visualization is about?
- Can you describe what this data visualization is telling you?
- What do you think about the colors in this visualization?
- What story do you think this visualization is trying to tell? 
- Who do you think the intended audience for this visualization is?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
