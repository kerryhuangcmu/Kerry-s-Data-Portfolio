# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II
**Added** a navigation page with titles on the top of the website, which helps viewers navigate through the story and key information. 

**Added** a user demographic section based on Part II feedback. User demographic was something that was brought up multiple times during the feedback sessions but interviewees have different opinions on this. I decided that I need one to focus my topic more. I picked 3 apps based on the data of the most downloaded dating apps in June 2024, and highlighted the age group that uses the app the most. This way I ensure I go into the story with a focus and can expand the intended audience after I capture interests. 

**Reformatted** the structure of the story. This included using new templates such as “Grid” and “Standard Text”. I picked these templates because they are more organized than the original ones I used. The original ones have only text boxes in the center that need to be scrolled. These templates helped guide viewers in a structured way. 

**Changed** the data design. Originally, I used tableau for all my designs. When the designs were rich embedded into Shorthand, I realized they were either formatted weirdly or had a lot of blank space. In order to keep the aesthetics, I changed some of my graphs using Datawrapper, which made the graphs fit more smoothly into the website. For the “Fake Profiles” section, I originally had a rich embedded tableau link, but with preview the formatting was weird, so I uploaded a screenshot of my design with a link added, so viewers can link on the image and direct them to the link in tableau public. 

**Privacy** of names. I originally had a quote from a victim of “The Tinder Swindler” and I explicitly used her name. I thought it was more credible. However, I decided to keep only her initials and “The Tinder Swindler” because although I obtained the quote from a public website, and the documentary is also public source, I felt using initials better align with the goal of the story to focus on data instead of one specific person, because everyone’s case is different. 


## The audience
I am bringing this information to people who use dating apps. I tried to narrow my focus by talking to my interviewees in part 2 and presenting my draft to friends to see whether they have a clear understanding of what I’m trying to say. After taking the suggestion of including a user demographic from my interviewees (_from the question Are you able to understand which specific group my story is targeting? In second round of interviews in Part II_), I created a new section titled “User Demographic” for Bumble, Tinder, and Hinge. I am primarily targeting people from age 18-34, which are the main users of these three most downloadable dating apps, according to data source. As my story moves on, I’m not only capturing the attention of those ages 18-34 by using the pie charts showing the user demographics, but also expanding to people who use dating apps.

# Final thoughts

This is both a challenging and interesting project. It is challenging because I need to find an easily understandable way to tell the story without interrupting the flow of the story structure. Data visualizations needs to be both creative and also straight to the point. My most challenging parts are choosing the focus of my story, as well as finding the most relevant and credible source to use. Due to my story is linking to some elements of privacy (ex. data on users), I was unable to access very detailed information on users of apps. Therefore, I picked an alternative path of looking at numbers of scams and monetary loss, which is another perspective of breaking down how romance scams can greatly impact people. The project tests my skills to think strategically and critically, which are skills I can definetly utilize in my industry research and report in future.
